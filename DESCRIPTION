Description: MobileTrigger is a framework for interacting with
  R modules such as Reports, Models, and Scripts from a mobile device. 
  The framework allows you to list available modules and select a
  module of interest using a basic e-mail interface. After 
  selecting a specific module, you can either run it as is or 
  provide input via the e-mail interface. After parsing your
  request, R will send the results back to your mobile device.
