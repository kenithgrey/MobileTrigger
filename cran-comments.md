 * Fixxed commented code line in GetModel.Rd. Rechecked other functions. 

## Resubmission 1
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

 * Made the Description a paragraph in the DESCRIPTION file.
 * Removed the license file and file reference in the DESCRIPTION.
 * Made sure the user has to specify where functions write to.
 * Used /donttest{} in examples rather than commenting out.

##Test Environments

* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on-travis-ci), (R 3.6 and devel)
